## What is this?
A submission for the [Flutter Puzzle Hack](https://flutterhack.devpost.com/) 🧩 by Calamity210.

The only real constraints we were given for this hack are:
> All submissions must be slide puzzles. That means that the players “slide” a limited number of tiles into place to achieve a goal.
Word puzzles, etc. will not be accepted.

While most people went straight to the traditional 15-block sliding puzzle, I wanted to make something that many people were not also making.

This game is the outcome, a sokoban-inspired sliding puzzle. It falls perfectly into the constraints we were given, the player slides a number of boxes into place to complete the level.
